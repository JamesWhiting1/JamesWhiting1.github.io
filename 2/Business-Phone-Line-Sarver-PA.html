<p>An IP PBX is a VoIP system-- that is, it sends out voice signals over the internet rather than standard phone lines. This implies your consumers can call one number and speak to anybody in your office. The most obvious and a lot of widely promoted advantage of VoIP is the ability to perform a business phone call regardless of where the receiver is located or whether you're in the office. Instead of stressing differences that allow significantly targeted and powerful messaging, this type of segmentation aims to find populations of customers who share a notion of what makes up outstanding service.</p>
<p>Calls from your cellphone will appear as your office phone in Caller ID. Because the voice signal is separated into data packets as an IP call, topped the internet, and reassembled at its location (kind of like a Star Trek transporter), instead of tying up a copper peer-to-peer landline circuit, long-distance calls are cheaper through VoIP-- another cost savings point. Instead of utilizing telephone lines, VoIP utilizes SIP trunks (SIP represents session initiation protocol).</p>
